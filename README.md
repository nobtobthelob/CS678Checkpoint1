# CS678Checkpoint1

For our reproduction we had to create two models a T5 model and a bert model. Github wouldn't let us put the models directly into the repository so we included
links to them here: T5: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-bv_MQO51n7zCN800AKJLs6BebFpLpHE/view?usp=sharing 
and BERT: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HDT81F5KU8hLYz3vyeQVYiMvOx79lFY/view?usp=share_link. To run our notebook simply download and put these two models in the
same directory as the notebook and you will be able to test the candidate sentence generation and the generation of context and related words from a given pun word.

Thanks!
